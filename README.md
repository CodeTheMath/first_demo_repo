# first_demo_repo
this is just a first repositiory I created to make some experiment wit git and jupyter notebooks.
The notebook presents an interpolation using a Newtons Polynolial. The walues of interpolation polinomial are evaluated in a numerically efficient way using nested method. You can access notebook interactively by using a link below. Please keem in mind that bulbing virtual envirometn by MyBinder can take a while.
